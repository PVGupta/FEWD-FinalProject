            <h4>Dayanita Singh – <i>‘Privacy’</i></h4>
            <p>
              Privacy, defined as the quality or condition of being secluded from the presence or view of others, involves an avoidance of public attention (Free Dictionary, 2016). Dayanita Singh’s series of photographs titled ‘Privacy’ materialize in a photo-book that was published in 2003, and exhibited in Berlin the same year. An advent believer of ‘portable museums’, her book grants the public easy access to her photographs; therefore challenging the title of her series by the very form she uses for their presentation. I find all 91 photographs thought provoking because she tears apart every notion of the word “privacy”, making us question what it stands for in society today. Her series is composed of formal portraits of affluent families in India, as well as empty spaces that occupy their houses, ironically implying a presence of sorts. Born in 1961 in New Delhi, Singh’s works embrace the world she grew up in.

              Through her portraits of India’s familial elite, Singh manages to capture the curated version of themselves they wish to show to the public, as well as glimpses into their private lives. It was through the juxtaposition present in her photographs, that I fully understood the concept of commissioned portraits and the purpose they serve for the photographed. Commissioned photographs are a means to show the world a version of yourself you would like to present. In an analog world, they are the Facebook of photography. Decked in crisp saris and 18-carat diamonds, the people in Singh’s photographs exude an elegant, affluent vibe.

              However, by capturing their household-help in motion attempting to rush away from the frame, the audience is made privy to what is not meant for the public’s eye as well. Singh sheds light on both the foreground and the background, such that a symbiosis of sorts is apparent; with the latter knowing it has to take the backseat. In portraying this play of power, Singh never steps out of her boundaries as a documentary photographer. The photographs are relatable to middle class societies in India, and one feels as if they know one or more of the families featured. Singh herself comments in the preface to her book, “I do not think of these (detail(s) of a door or a crockery cabinet) as photographs, just as little notes” (Singh, 2003). It is interesting to note that the photographed consist of both commissioned photographs, as well as photographs of her family and friends. The sense of familiarity that Singh brings out in her composition accentuates the contradiction behind the series’ title, “privacy”.
